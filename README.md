### What is Sagbit?

Sagbit is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Sagbit uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Sagbit Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Sagbit Core software, see http://sagbit.com/#download, or read the
[original whitepaper](http://sagbit.com/?page_id=6091).

### sagbit done right

This is the Android port of the sagbitwallet iOS app, which can be found [here](https://github.com/sagbit/sagbitwallet-ios/).

##### a completely standalone sagbit wallet:

Unlike many other sagbit wallets, sagbitwallet is a real standalone sagbit
client. There is no server to get hacked or go down, so you can always access
your money. Using
[SPV](https://en.sagbit.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security#Header-Only_Clients)
mode, sagbitwallet connects directly to the sagbit network with the fast
performance you need on a mobile device.

##### the next step in wallet security:

sagbitwallet is designed to protect you from malware, browser security holes,
*even physical theft*. With AES hardware encryption, app sandboxing, and verified boot, sagbitwallet represents a significant security advance over
web and desktop wallets.

##### beautiful simplicity:

Simplicity is sagbitwallet's core design principle. A simple backup phrase is
all you need to restore your wallet on another device if yours is ever lost or
broken.  Because sagbitwallet is  
[deterministic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki),
your balance and transaction history can be recovered from just your backup
phrase.
